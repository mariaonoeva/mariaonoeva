We are happy to announce that our workshop **<font size= "4">Polar (yes/no) questions: form, meaning and more</font>** has been accepted to [The Biennial of Czech Linguistics](https://bcl2024.ff.cuni.cz/en/home/). The Biennial 2024 is the first edition of a new conference taking place at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University.

The concept of the conference builds on the model applied at the European level (the conference of [Societas Linguistica Europaea](https://societaslinguistica.eu/)) or in Germany (the conference of the [Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sprachwissenschaft](https://dgfs.de/en/)).

Here you find more information about our workshop (CfP, general description, etc.) and the conference. In case of any questions contact us at mariia.razguliaeva.1@hu-berlin.de or onoevam@ff.cuni.cz.

#### Workshop description 
Questions pose a challenge for the traditional truth-conditional semantics because their meaning cannot be reduced to the truth or falsity of a proposition. Among the prominent approaches to this problem are the analyses of Hamblin (1973) and Groenendijk and Stokhof (1984) according to which a question denotes a set of propositions corresponding to its possible or true answers. In the case of polar questions (PQs), the sets contain two answers corresponding to ‘yes’ and ‘no’. However, these approaches alone do not seem to capture some question functions in language and discourse.

For instance, the impact of negation on PQs is beyond the scope of such approaches since the ultimate semantic meaning would be independent of the presence or absence of negation (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984). Positive (‘Is it raining?’) and negative PQs (‘Is it not raining?’ / ‘Isn’t it raining?’) differ in the contexts where they can be used (Sudo 2013, Kopecký 2010, AnderBois 2019) and in the possible reactions to them (Farkas and Bruce 2009). Negation itself can have a different effect depending on the nature of the negation operator and its place in the derivational structure (Ladd 1981, Romero and Han 2004, Abels 2005). 

Many different strategies of indicating PQs are observed across languages, ranging from question particles in Mandarin and verb morphology in Korean over interrogative word order in German to intonation in Modern Standard Arabic (Dryer 2013). Along with the neutral expressions of question meaning, pragmatically marked variants of PQs have also been studied. These can contain certain particles like vajon in Hungarian (Gärtner and Gyuris 2023), -no and -desho in Japanese (Sudo 2013), and razve in Russian (Repp 2013, Korotkova 2023), as well as diverge in word order (Gunlogson 2002, Staňková 2023) or prosodic patterns (e.g., Grice and Savino 2003, Goodhue 2022, Esipova and Romero 2023). Exploring the conditions in which these types of questions can occur has led to multiple notions of an additional layer of meaning that captures the discourse functions of an utterance (e.g., Gutzmann 2015, Ciardelli et al. 2018). 

This panel aims to bring together researchers who work on forms, meanings, and functions of PQs in their intra- and cross-linguistic variability. We invite a diverse range of submissions that draw upon theoretical observations, experimental results, corpus research, and other relevant perspectives. The goal is to establish a productive dialog between different approaches and gain new insights into the nature of PQs. It is planned to address the following research questions (the list is not exhaustive):

1) How do forms of PQs map to various facets of their meanings across languages? 

2) Which contexts can be considered natural for certain PQ types? 

3) How can the meaning of PQs be formalized and what predictions emerge from certain formalizations?

4) How are PQs processed by speakers, as well as during language acquisition and/or learning?
