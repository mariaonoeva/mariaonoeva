Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

__THIS PAGE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT__

Maria, Маша, Maruška, ~~Mariia~~. 

I'm :sparkles: almost :sparkles: a third year PhD student in General Linguistics and a research assistant at the <a href='https://www.ff.cuni.cz/home/'>Charles University</a> . I explore semantics and pragmatics of polar questions with the main focus on Russian and other Slavic laguages. My research is a part of the [QueSlav project](https://www.radeksimik.eu/minilab.html). The person who navigates me through my studies (aka my advisor) is [Radek Šimík](https://www.radeksimik.eu/personalia.html).     

I got my BA and MA degrees in General Linguistics from the Masaryk University in Brno. My first language is Russian and I'm also kind of fluent in English and Czech.

The goal is to finish my PhD thesis until 30 y.o. I'll keep you posted.
