PQs in the name of this section stands for **Polar Questions**, and they are the focus of my PhD reasearch. PQs are those which can be answered with either 'yes' or 'no', as *Do you like cats?* (oh yes!). Besides this question type, there are two more: **constituent** (or wh-questions) as *What is your favorite computer game?* when a full answer is required, and **alternative** which provides you with ready-made options as in *Was 'Crime and Punishment' written by Dostoevsky or Tolstoy?*. All of them are fascinating and worth studying, but here I focus on PQs.

People call PQs many names in different languages. For instance in Russian, they are *obščie voprosy* so 'general' or 'common' questions. In Czech, it is *zjišťovací otázky* 'elicit questions', in German *Entscheidungsfrage* 'decision questions'. You see, despite PQs apparent simplicity, researches are very puzzled by these questions and after two years of investigation I know exactly why.  

So far idk what to post here, well maybe my presentations from the conferences.
