Polar questions are questions to which you answer with either 'yes' or 'no'. People call them many names in different languages, for instance in Russian they are <i>obščie voprosy</i> which stand for 'general questions'. In Czech, it is <i>zjišťovací otázky</i> 'elicit questions' which I find curious because why only this type of questions was named this way, all questions elicit information, don't they? 

So far idk what to post here, well maybe my presentations from the conferences.
