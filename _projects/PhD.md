'PQs' in the name of this section stands for **Polar Questions**. PQs are those which can be answered with either 'yes' or 'no', as *Do you like cats?* (oh yes!). Besides this question type, there are two more. **Constituent** (or wh-questions) as *What is your favorite computer game?* require a full answer. **Alternative** provide you with ready-made options as in *Was 'Crime and Punishment' written by Dostoevsky or Tolstoy?*, there are two authors to select from. All of them are fascinating and worth studying, but here I focus on PQs.

People call PQs many names in different languages. For instance in Russian, they are *obščie voprosy/общие вопросы* 'general' or 'common' questions. In Czech, it is *zjišťovací otázky* 'elicit questions', in German *Entscheidungsfrage* 'decision questions'. You see, despite PQs apparent simplicity, researches are very puzzled by these questions.  

(I hope to add more on this soon.)

So far idk what to post here, well maybe the presentations from the conferences.
