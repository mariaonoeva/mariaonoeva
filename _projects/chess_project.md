Here is my chess.com account -- [:chess_pawn::chess_pawn::chess_pawn:](https://www.chess.com/member/xoroshulia).

The Elo rating system is used to measure chess skills. It was developed by Arpard Elo, check out [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to learn more about it. Super Grandmasters have around 2700-2900 Elo in classical (slow 3-hour) games, in online Blitz and Rapid formats they score more than 3000 Elo. I'm around 700 now. 

(I'm planning to add a tracker of my ELO here, stay tuned!)
