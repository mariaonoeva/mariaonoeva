The Elo rating system is used to measure chess skills. It was developed by Arpard Elo, check out [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to learn more about it. Super Grandmasters have around 2500-2800 Elo in classical games which take usually more than 3 hours. In faster formats, for example Blitz (3 min) and Rapid (10 min and more), they might have the score above 3000 Elo. I'm around 700 now. 

(I'm planning to add a tracker of my Elo here, stay tuned!)
